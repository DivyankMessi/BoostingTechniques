    "Answer : Boosting in machine learning is an ensemble method where multiple \"weak learners\" (models with slightly better than random guessing accuracy) are trained sequentially, with each learner focusing on the mistakes of its predecessors. This iterative process results in a \"strong learner\" â€“ a model that's significantly more accurate and robust. "

    "Answer : Bagging and boosting are ensemble learning methods that combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy, but they differ in their approach to training these models. Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, trains multiple models independently in parallel on different subsets of the training data, which helps reduce variance. Boosting, on the other hand, trains models sequentially, with each model focusing on correcting the errors of the previous model, which helps reduce bias. "

    "Answer : AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple \"weak learners\" (simple classifiers) to create a stronger, more accurate model. It works by iteratively training weak learners, focusing on misclassified instances in each iteration and adjusting weights accordingly. The algorithm assigns higher weights to misclassified instances, making them more prominent in subsequent training rounds. This allows the weak learners to correct previous errors, leading to a final ensemble that performs better than any individual weak learner. \n",
